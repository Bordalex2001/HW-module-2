    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p class="Formula">ax + b = 0</p>
    <p>where <span class="Letter">a</span> and <span class="Letter">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="Letter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="Letter">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="Letter">x</span> there.</p>
    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="Formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
    <p>where <span class="Letter">a</span>, <span class="Letter">b</span>, <span class="Letter">c</span> are known values and <span class="Letter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="Letter">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
    <p><span class="Letter">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="Letter">r</span>) squared:</p>
    <p class="Formula">A = &pi; &Cross; r<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="Letter">D</span>):</p>
    <p class="Formula">A = (&pi; / 4) &Cross; D<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="Letter">C</span>):</p>
    <p class="Formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &Cross; &pi;</p>
    <h2>Intersection</h2>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="Letter">A</span> and <span class="Letter">B</span>, denoted by A &Intersection; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <p class="Formula">A &Intersection; B = { x : x &Element; A and x &Element; B }</p>
    <p>That is, <span class="Letter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &Intersection; B if and only if <span class="Letter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="Letter">A</span> and an element of <span class="Letter">B</span>.</p>
